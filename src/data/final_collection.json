You're not gonna face a 30mm head on. If you do then your planning was fucked. You're gonna face FPV's and Artillary instead. So I think it's light enough to be used in Russian mud and with the slat armor it does seem to cover a lot of the vehicle. I think it's more and more likely MOD will adopt it desu.It's funny if this is 20t the Israeli Etrian IFV is like 50t. But both would get clapped if a RPG hits the right spot anyways.

Supporting attacks were made through the treelines on the tactical heights south of Novoivanivka, resulting in the southern part of the village being quickly captured. Other forces then captured the northern streets as well as the southern ends of the adjacent treelines. From there, Russian forces went on to push northwest along the treelines in the low-lying ground towards the eastern outskirts of Novohryhorivka, capturing positions there and on the heights to the south. They were also able to eliminate the small Ukrainian salient south of Novomykolaivka, capturing the treelines and forested areas there. >Further north, Russian forces stormed Berezove from the east, and after brief consolidation efforts, captured the rest of the village and entered the treelines to the north. Other assault groups advanced along the treelines southwest of Berezove, and reached the northeastern outskirts of Kalynivske where they secured the main Ukrainian defensive node in the area. >In the north, after a period of fighting, Russian forces cleared out the encircled Ukrainian soldiers in the western part of Sichneve, finally bringing the village under their control. They also captured the treelines in the grey zone west of the settlement.https://t.me/AMK_Mapping/17591",

Particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.>There's nothing new in this — similar theses have appeared in the European segment since late August and at least in Lithuania, military departments were fully aware of the situation.>It's worth emphasizing that the reduction in aid is promised to be gradual, so reporting a sudden halt in funding would be premature. But for Baltic state authorities, the news is certainly unpleasant. After all, they have already begun scaling back all possible European programs for the sake of economy.>Moreover, the Western news segment writes that the situation will not affect the deployment of US troops in the region and financial support within a separate program administered by the State Department.

No more than 8.It searches for the '0/10 no tail\" string within the message. Adding any symbol or a line break in the middle of this string causes the bot to miss it.E.g. this: 0/10 no tail.Doesn't trigger the script.Basically the moment you drop the T-bomb you're on borrowed time. Thus:—Starting out with the non-filtered catchphrases means you stay on the air longer. —Having a second browser with captchas solved ready to post on the moment's notice allows for getting up to 8 minutes on uninterrupted tailposting if you start right after the first identity gets b&.—Altering the key catchphrase fools the script (for now) and the posts have to be b& manually. Human janitor response time is still rather slow, you're just tripping the script.Tested it extensively but using non-Russian IPs; maybe the script has extra rules for those.",

Then boast about taking over white companies and voting themselves CEO before running these companies into the ground. They do the same thing with governments, and have taken over the premierships of England, Scotland, and Wales, and are inviting in millions of their fellow jeets to take a big fat racial shit all over Britain.We actually will not only need a new internet where we can get away from Pajeets, but if demographic trends are to persist, a new planet entirely.Even anti-white shitskin loving libtards find them so fucking repulsive that they fedpost about total jeet death on REDDIT.

We write to you with a simple plea - do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.",

In an X post on Saturday, September 20, Kolvet addressed an online discussion about the lack of an exit wound after Kirk was shot on September 10 at Utah Valley University. He said he spoke directly with the surgeon who worked on Kirk at the hospital.>KOLVET>The name Kolvet is a surname of Eastern European Jewish origin, derived from the Yiddish word kolvet, meaning \"to cover\" or \"to protect\". This suggests a historical occupational link for people bearing the name to roles involving safeguarding or providing shelter.ahahahahahahahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH",

They literally desire to arrest and kill people like me for telling you about firewalls. But they want to anyways so who cares! Our minds are compartmentalized by firewalls depending on our loyalties, races, and covert caste systems which are also chemically enforced thru punitive psychiatry!!! can anyone tell us how to firewall our minds? The schizo meds are poison coercing you to suicide from their ear torture, when it's actually super easy for them to simply firewall you.

Somebody being Vegetarian can't affect you negatively in any way. In fact it increases your own resoruces even indirectly (\"more meat for you\"). Also add the fact Indians have their own religion (so no acceptance of Jewish child molestation in the name of \"god\"). and of course non violence - which they redirect into \"indians being weak\" narrative.

The policy was meant to keep the Palestinians divided, a tactic that critics say backfired and strengthened Hamas over time. Details of the strategyThe \"divide and rule\" strategy: For years, Netanyahu believed that strengthening Hamas in Gaza would undermine the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and prevent the formation of a unified Palestinian state. As he reportedly stated in 2019, \"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas\".Uh oh rabbi, walls closing in",

Cox also said that one of Robinson's relatives had told investigators that during a family dinner, Robinson had expressed dislike of Kirk and discussed his upcoming visit to Utah Valley University.[117] While Trump and elected Republicans alleged Robinson was connected to left-wing groups and threatened a crackdown on them, no evidence exists that Robinson was connected to left-wing groups.[118]>On September 16, prosecutor Jeff Gray stated that the \"suspect had become increasingly concerned about gay and trans rights\" and that he had grown apart from his family's conservative views, citing Robinson's relationship with his transgender roommate as a factor. Gray further outlined details of text messages that the prosecution believes Robinson sent to his roommate, which stated that he had been planning the shooting for just over a week. When the roommate asked why Robinson had done it, he answered, \"I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.\"[1][90] According to ABC News, the charging documents did not \"indicate the relevance of those stances or whether Kirk's remarks about those issues were a motivating factor\", and reported \"Gray said he would let a judge determine whether the statements allegedly made constituted a confession.\"[1]Most of this was known when Kimmel made his statement btw",

I don't care about reactionary shit or gloating or seething, the real question here is why aren't these companies facing any real loss? The answer is that the media engages in its own flavor of bread & circus kabuki, they pay for articles like this to be aired/released when seemingly controversial events go down to steer public consciousness towards their agenda or into not caring at all. You truly do not hate the media enough and they are severely under-regulated. Kimmel's firing doesn't matter in the slightest, hosts have been fired for far less like simply for swearing on live TV. Whether the government asked for it or not is irrelevant, government used to mandate that swearing wasn't allowed on TV out moral preservation for society too.",

Will boomers sell out once again to the banks to save themselves from a failing system that they created?

Either Evropa unites or it gets carved up and dies within a state of division. If you know Alexander Dugin or John Mearsheimer, you'll know that they want a carved up Europe, where Dugin wants Europe to be carved up to be part of the greater Eurasian empire. Meanwhile John Mearsheimer wants Europe to be split in half by the US and Russia, with the west being US puppets and the east being Russian (like in the cold war). If you know the Jews, there is nothing they wouldn't enjoy more than for Evropa to be in a highly divided, broken state.The logical conclusion is to unite, and that is why there needs to be a pro-EU far-right movement, to preserve the concept of the EU while pushing for reform to change the EU so that it isn't controlled by Jews.",

Whether it was Pan-Greekism against the Persians, Pan-Romanism against various invaders, Pan-Slavism against the Mongols, or Pan-Germanicism against the Russian Empire, these movements have been crucial for our defense and preservation. Today, we face new challenges that threaten the very existence of our culture and identity. By uniting under the banner of Ethnic-European Nationalism, we can ensure the security and flourishing of our people.

But unfortunately, Hitler lost, and now we got the jewish clownworld instead where half of Europe was ruled by judeo-bolsheviks for almost a century and after that ordeal was over, straight into hands of jewish international klepto-capitalists that buy your lands and housing to give to third worlders on your dime, bought with the interest they have charged from your entire fucking country.So obviously uniting as a real, strong, national socialist confederacy and keeping all the parasites out and sending the non-Europeans the fuck back to their own homes, is the ONLY way we are going to have any future.We could call it Fourth Reich, and if we make it happen I seriously doubt that the jews will be able to fool the Anglos to fight for the jews against Europe and against their own kin again",

Although its aim was to grant equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, that is, the charging of interest as profit on loans), annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors, and soldiers, voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent, and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by restricting their business activities, while allowing work in agriculture and craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.So it's not like French didn't have their own problems with kikes and a lot of people actually welcomed Hitler throwing out the banker kikes - just like many would welcome him today. The American allies had literal nigger rapists in tow though who raped French women after 'liberating' France with bombs.Something which the Wehrmacht never did, they treated the French public with care and respect.In fact, more French civilians died from the ((Allies)) \"liberation\" than by the Nazi invasion.",

Now the people must possess some means of giving expression to their thoughts or their wishes. Analysing this problem more closely, we see that the people themselves have originally no convictions of their own. Their convictions are learned, of course, just as everywhere else. The decisive question is who enlightens the people, who educates them>In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: 'Here we have liberty.' By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty.>These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the 'freedom of the press.'>In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion.>Public opinion thus mobilized by them is, in its turn, split up into political parties. The difference between these parties is as small as it formerly was in Germany. You know them, of course - the old parties. They were always one and the same.>These parties, with this press, they control public opinion.- Adolf Hitler - Speech to the Workers of Berlin, 10 December 1940",

I admit though I don't have any actual specifics, but it is really weird that their stance on Russia is so soft and that they tend to parrot Russian propaganda and talking points. Grzegorz Braun for instance, the almighty far-right Polish patriot that wants to make Poland independent from the EU. This same guy wants to build a huge gas pipeline with Belarus and become dependent on Russian gas. Sounds quite weird for someone who wants sovereignty.",

In reality the average long-term bullshit job will usually exist because of some stupid regulation that requires an individual with X license to be in Y position all day in order to check Z box under the XYZ compliance reporting schedule requirements. Besides that there will indeed be many examples of \"organic\" bullshit jobs that crop up in the (relative) short-term at megacorps where inefficiency won't be noticed immediately, but it's not some bizarre deliberately strategy straight from the C-suite, that would just be inexplicable. In a way though this is actually a good thing because this kind of gradual bloat and sluggish response to change is a natural dampener to the growth of companies over time and allows smaller, leaner competitors to enter the market and keep competition steady. And frankly, a lot of the perception of bullshit jobs is also from jealous service sector wagies who simply cannot conceive of the purpose of most office jobs because they've never been exposed to the environment and cope by claiming it's all \"bullshit\".",

The phenomena of bullshit jobs is very well studied, and they've made surveys, and about half of the very people working in offices themselves will admit that their job produces nothing of value.While it is true that credentialism forced by regulation plays a role, the #1 cause of bullshit jobs are gender and racial quotas in the workplace.There are laws in most Western countries forcing corporations to hire a minimum % of women, and a percentage of nonwhites in the US too.Corporations try to find qualified personnel that are either women or nonwhites, but rarely find enough of them. That's why they have to create countless useless administrative positions just to employ women and nonwhites and have them around in the office doing pointless busywork all day around.I've experienced this first-hand in the metalworking industry. There are simply no women willing to do these jobs, and thus it's basically impossible for the company to fill positions in the workshop with women. So, for every few men they are forced to hire another woman that basically does nothing in the office all day, only hired for having a pussy.It's one of the main reasons blue collar wages have been stagnant for DECADES. The men who do all the real work have to support useless and parasitic gender & diversity hires with their labor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDTdLQnSQo",

The only ones that are allowed to even think of living the \"husband works, wife stays home\" lifestyle are the top 25% of earners, give or take, and they'll do it sparingly here and there at that.The main purpose of all of these bullshit jobs is to destabilize the economy, which in turn damages the nuclear family. The government tries its absolute damndest to destroy the nuclear family as much as they can. Requiring every single woman to get a job, no matter how useless or low paying it is, deflates male wages, which makes providing for a family even harder.It's one of the main reasons why even with TWO median incomes, you're making less than a normal man did 40 years ago.The nuclear family provided absolutely everything the government is trying to provide, and they want to replace the nuclear family. And how will our population increase in the face of this? Well, immigration of course. Immigration has supplanted birth rates as the preferred method of population growth. And there's more of a general apathy to immigration because we have no families to form no societies to want to protect against a wave of third worlders that produce nothing.But I digress. The government truly desires women to work, even if it's do-nothing bullshit work, to keep them away from starting a family. Gender quotas are absolutely irrefutable proof of this. Women, en masse, do not work jobs that create wealth, nor provide a skilled service in any way.For all of those people that support Universal Basic Income on the basis that not everyone needs to work to sustain society, they forget that we already implemented this system long ago. We had a class of people long ago that didn't need to work and were provided for. They were called women.",

An enormous percentage of men are unwilling or simply incapable of supporting a woman and a family. So the woman absolutely needs a job in order to just make ends meet, even IF she finds a good man to start a family with.But it's a horrible mindset because it's putting the cart before the horse. It's saying \"I will sacrifice my plan A to make sure I have a plan B\". Ideally, a woman turns 18, and very shortly after she finds a good man willing and capable of supporting her, and starts a family with them. The only problem with this is that women are practically coached into thinking that you can never rely on a man, men are trash, men are evil, men will use you, men will abuse you, so you need to treat your potential husband as a potential criminal/rapist/murderer/abuser, until he proves otherwise.It's operating from a defeated mindset from the go, so of course it's going to just result in a self fulfilling prophecy. If you treat every man as a failure and abuser, you're going to miss out on the few good, capable men.",

Most men are garbage and plenty are willing to pretend to be good until they can trap a woman, a trap which is all the harder to escape without independent financial freedom.

Instead I have a catalog of 16-17 year old coworkers that would fuck their sophisticated college guy manager. When I had a gf from school it was like beating back succubi. Being able to steal a college girls bf was a prime motivator so I always had a gf even when I didn’t. If a friend came in for free food I would pretend I was going to make a move and some girl there would make her move. I also had access to weed and booze and would let them spend the night. If you’ve never had three slutty girls spend the night at the shit apt your parents are paying for, you haven’t lived . I remember in high school trying so hard to be a good guy and take gals out and treat them nice only for hardly any ass and realizing you have to be in a dominant position and then they compete for your dick.Any of you married bros know your wife had that one older guy she still remembers as her first real fuck. That was me for like 10 girls. My wife ended up knowing a girl I fucked a bunch in her baby class when she was pregnant. I saw her full of babies and said hi and introduced them and she gushed to my wife, who was jelly but then super horny that this other pregnant girl was attractive and told her some college stories about me.But I pity the fools that try to placate their contemporary feminists. You will never win and if you get one they already fucked their McDonald’s manager for fun while making you beg.You either break them in or end up with a broken in one. Choose wisely. Plus there is little more exhilarating that a teenage pregnancy scare! The drama of a late period turns into a whole friend group cream pie panic as they all get massively turned on at the idea and then the pregnant one has her period a day late and everyone sighs relief and try again next month.",

Women used to take pride in being a wife and mother, because it reflected her sexual market value.Now, women can make much more money selling simulated sex to men online (simps). Now women take pride in being a very popular whore because that's what reflects her sexual market value now. Women have always been whores, but the whore market has changed.",

Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.\"--Bhagavad Gita 16:8-12",

Issie Issie (イッシー, Isshī) is the Japanese Loch Ness monster. its a real creature called a Plesiosaur. just like theres tellings of dragons. they're dinosaurs. Beowulf was a guy who killed fucking dinosaurs, bro. the Grendel was \"Corpse Grinder\" like a T-rex sort of rascal with the little arms. how else you think he managed to rip it off? and the one that lived at the bottom of the lake? hmm.. think about it, chief. the viking boats looked like these things because for a time they were common but are now super rare or extinct. the Thunderbird of the Americas was a large sort of Pterodactylus. and they would ride the thermal updrafts from the massive storm clouds that used to sweep over the North American lakes which drained out into the Gulf of Mexico creating the Grand Canyon and leaving plains behind. and they'd ride the winds to the tops of mountains where they'd nest in the cliffs. America is the \"land of the plummed serpent\" which i believe is Atlantis and also the original place of Camelot. what you thought this place was only discovered a few hundred years ago but its been here for like hundreds of millions of years?

Which is the same flood described in the Bible, once again because Odin = Noah. and so one of those worlds or realms on the world tree is \"Middle earth\" and it was formed by the ice or teeth of Ymir as they described it poetically. but it was the glaciers that eventually slide out to sea and melted, carving massive valleys which became lush and green at some levels, or became immense lakes, like Loch Ness. and these water dragons or dinosaurs lived within these very deep lakes because there was many cave systems as well. they also lived in more swampy areas, accounts of them in places like Africa. all around the world. so its not about anyone stealing anyone elses culture or lore. ultimately its all of ours. because we all descend from Noah and his sons. they were also the Olympians to the Greeks. there were three sons listed for Noah. Ham, Shem and Japheth, who were Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. and they were seen as gods because they lived to be nearly 1,000 years old before the flood, but afterwards people became \"mortals\". maturing or aging more rapidly. and these guys were incredible, i'm sure. very intelligent and physically able. probably larger than we are. but their kids in the post flood world? maybe some of them were a bit dumb for certain reasons. ignorant, wild, feral. its why some were known as trolls. there was a race of them for awhile. they were inbred. where as the Bible said, they saw the daughters of men were hot so they made wives and had children with them. which at first were demigods but then things averaged out.",

I'm not talking about the Tolkien elves (fantasy elves, especially in the \"high\" variant, have more in common with concept like angels, demigods and nephilim). Btw japanese youkai and Kamis share more things that you think with the animist and pantheistic systems out of Japan. As other anons said, the major difference is that in Japan those entities still have shrine and temples, and in europe they have not.

It is castrated in some ways, compared to the older one, but AFAIK this is specifically an issue with optimization, i.e. a lot of it had to be turned down to shit because the performance was even worse than it was on launch. At the same time IMO people like to overstate how a-life worked back in the day in original games. Nostalgia glasses or whatever. The biggest issue for me is how some of the spawns are retarded, e.g. you've observed from afar that there are 5 retards there, you go in and dispatch them, everything's good, then you start looting the location, turn a corner and there are 3 more retards materialized out of nowhere. I know that for some situation it's specifically designed to be that way and it's actually fun (e.g. when you leave some of the locations with caches and such), but sometimes it seems it's an artifact of a castrated a-life system mostly. Kinda like not having binoculars, because having them would force the engine to turn the offline retards into online ones from afar tanking the performance of that chink-owned engine.",

I mean, they’re devastated right now. Everybody is devastated.\"Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded in 2012, released guidelines Saturday night for those attending the service, including a patriotic dress code and a strict no-bag policy.The memorial, titled, \"Building a Legacy: Remembering Charlie Kirk,\" will begin at 11a.m. local time (2p.m. ET) and is \"first come, first served based on stadium capacity,\" according to the event website.State Farm Stadium, home to the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals, has fixed seating for 63,400 and can expand to over 73,000 for larger events, according to the venue. >Live Updates:https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/charlie-kirk-memorial-services-glendale-arizona-9-21-2025>anyone on the ground in Glendale? cross streets? attending?",

          "content": ">Zie hier de naïviteit van de Christenen Dit draadje is een perfect voorbeeld van de Christelijke naïviteit. Mirjam Bikker vraagt zich af wat haar standpunt met links of rechts te maken heeft? Alsof we niet al jaren toekijken hoe de politiek verworden is tot een strijd tussen twee kampen die elk hun eigen religie aanbidden: de links-liberale dogma's en de conservatieve waarden.Petra's reactie, dat Bikker de 'taal van uiterst rechts overneemt', is ironisch. Links predikt tolerantie, maar accepteert alleen meningen die binnen hun eigen smalle denkkader passen. Ze hebben het over inclusie, maar sluiten iedereen die de westerse traditie verdedigt effectief uit. Het is de klassieke strategie: de tegenstander monddood maken door ze te framen als 'intolerant' of 'rechts-extremistisch'. Zo hoeven ze nooit de inhoud van het debat aan te gaan.Het is lachwekkend hoe het huidige christendom, vertegenwoordigd door figuren zoals Bikker, zich heeft opgesteld. In hun drang om te bewijzen hoe progressief en tolerant ze zijn, verloochenen ze hun eigen wortels en cultuur. Ze kiezen ervoor om de islam te omarmen onder het mom van naastenliefde, terwijl ze de tradities waar Nederland op gebouwd is, vernaggelen. Dit is niet alleen culturele zelfmoord; het is de ultieme daad van politieke zelfkastijding. En zo verwordt het christendom tot een van de belangrijkste architecten van de ondergang van Nederland.",

They quickly discover they're the only men left after a nuclear war accidentally eradicated the male genepool and are now stuck in a all-female totalitarian state, where every child that is born is either a girl or is augmented into one. All of the women take pills to stop their motherly urges and sexual desires and are brainwashed (a strong mockery of radical feminism) to perceive males as a threat to society. So now they plan to turn the two remaining male protagonists into trannys as the two men try to escape.It's a perfect movie about two chuds waking up in a feminist hellhole, trying to restore balance, and now it's more relevant than ever.",

He could have had 3.5 grand and walked away and been set for a few months, but instead he went right back and thought if he played enough he'd win a jackpot. It's so infuriating.

I think the trick is that the casinos profile their customers with cameras in the machines, AI, whatever. When someone new like me plays a few games, they make us win a good amount of money. Usually a few hundred or a few thousand dollars. Nothing life changing. Basically they give you a little crack while you're still a baby so you become a bona fide crackhead adult down the line. I get this. I'm not impressed by \"winning\" a little money. Scammers do the same shit. I've had scammers literally give me hundreds of dollars in some pyramid scheme, and then they try to get you to invest back into it so it \"multiplies.\" It's dumb as bricks. And people, people are so dumb that the scammers can actually afford to take risks paying people like me. Someone like me isn't going to \"game\" the casinos anyway.

He also reported that they had as many wounded as killed.[264][184][185][265] However, former Russian officer and milblogger Igor Girkin opined that Wagner has likely suffered more than 40,000 killed in action (including 15,000 mercenaries and 25,000 convicts), with again the same number wounded. In part, this is based on a claimed discrepancy between the number of prisoners recruited and, the number either reported killed or repatriated at the end of their service.[266][267] Major General John Harrel, in his analysis of reported figures, highlights that out of the 50,000 convicts recruited by the Wagner Group, only 25,000 received pardons, with the remaining 25,000 killed. According to one report, the number of professional mercenaries killed may have reached 15,000, bringing the total number of Wagner personnel killed to approximately 40,000, with overall casualties – both killed and wounded – amounting to 80,000. Harrel estimates Wagner's personnel strength at 85,000 at the beginning of 2023, declining to 5,000 following the Battle of Bakhmut.",

I fucking hate niggers, jews, spics and jeets. I don't work for a few simple reasons. Story of my life: balding at 16, shredded the drums, went to Berklee college of music, parents stopped paying and put me in a mental hospital for months, in there I was sexually assaulted. Now I'm 34 years old and a NEET incel. My IQ was confirmed to be 135 which is genius tier. I'm on welfare and food stamps. My parents absolutely ruined my life and I haven't worked in over 10 years. Only sex I had was with prostitutes. I'm just waiting until my boomer parents croak and then I'll inherit a cool million. Fuck them for ruining my life, fuck them for the lies and gaslighting.

That first apple will be just as sweet to him, but he dreams of grandchildren he will never meet playing in its shade and climbing its branches.

Even before asians (at least Chinese) meet westerns, looking white is the beautiful standard.This is because the farmers and other hard labors who work under the sun will turn dark meanwhile the people who don't work in the field like government officers, rich merchant etc are pale. This also applies to women. In ancient China women going out was seen as not in line with social ethics. The daughter of rich families probably live under a roof for their entire life (home to carriage to other people's house) and look extremely pale. Meanwhile the farmers' wives have to help in the field and look dark.It is pretty much equal to \"tan\" in the West. In the West if you see a people with wheat/bronze skin you will feel it hot because it is a social status symbol. It suggests this person has time and money to go vacation and get tan. The mechanism is the same.pic is a famous drawing in China named Father and its shows the skin tone of farmers.",

Most Europeans noted that the men and women look extremely similar and there's countless mentions of how they didn't have any social restrictions on homosexuality. With Africans you can tell they select for certain fat distribution and secondary sexual characteristics like hips. With Asians when selection is described the prostitutes were painted in a particular way and the nobility had countless artificial selection methods like powdering a face a certain way, foot binding, and so on. Almost every romance they had in the past was about prostitutes or collecting concubines. Wtf was the average person selecting for because you'd expect a normal person to start naturally going for secondary sexual characteristics. Were they domesticated to the point where they were emulating nobles and chasing prostitutes? I sincerely don't get how their sexual dimorphism got as low as it is without the complete absence of competition.",

In the West people get turn on by obvious sexual characteristics like boob and ass and this hot. But I feel like in Asia (not only Japan) looking young is hot and neoteny on women is appraciated. This is the reason why you feel \"difference between man and women\" is small because natural selection doesn't go this way. Also the foot binding can aslo be seen as an ill mimic of neotenyI don't think westerns can at least get the idea of appricating neoteny because there are tons of Loli lovers in the west.",

I think the reason it's accepted that we only figured it out 10-12kya is because humanity was recovering from a major extinction event or catastrophe. I take all \"science\" with a grain of salt, unless it's physics or engineering or something concrete, but supposedly our distant ancestors had larger brain capacities than we do on average. Maybe like 10%. But just think about how autistic and smart some people are. It's all been done before. Hell I bet if we dig deep enough, check the oceans, there's probably some prehistoric computer the size of a labyrinth with water and stone chambers instead of capacitors and electricity. It might only have the processing power of a calculator but I'd bet my dignity on the idea something like that is out there.

          "content": "It's a long complex tell.It started back in the 80s when Corporations were unchained and the birth of the concept of \"latch key kids\". 24/7 news and media became a thing.Parents were spending more and more of their time working, so kids were raised by the media they consumed.The corporations took full advantage of this. They started to employee physiologists to understand how to manipulate kids(and people in general) into buying/consuming their crap. By the 90's, people had started to become tribal in their loyalty to brands. The Bit Wars, Coke V Pepsi, West V East coast rap. People basing their whole personality off their hobbies starts to become more common yet were ridiculed for it. Many of the kids in this decade were also latch kids who were molded from a young age to be good consumers and that TOY will bring happiness.The parents who spend alot of time working and now even have to do work at home to make sure their job does not get outsourced(it got outsourced) The 24/7 media noise is now firmly established.It's the 00's, The 24/7 media is all consuming and shaping the nation. High speed Internet becomes the norm. Social Media sites, 4chan, YouTube, and many other sites come online. Parents are working more than ever. Kids are surrounded by media that is built from the ground up to make them into the perfect consumer. People who based their whole personality off their hobby not only became more common but now instead of being made fun of for it people just thought people like The Angry Nintendo(Video Game) Nerd were cool. Astroturf identities become a thing, \"The Gamer\".The 2010's gave us Smart Phones. The 24/7 Media noise is now a 24/7 connection to the world thanks to the explosive popularity of various websites like the ones listed above and the Smartphone. People and kids are no longer just pressured by ads/media into buying things, now it's their friends, their family, content creators they watch all organically giving out free advertisements.",

The kids of the 80's are now middle aged, and the nostalgia farming off them was seemingly endless at the time. Many of them are like Kevin Smith, their personality is tied directly to their interests. Those 90s kids are now young adults, and fully embraced social media along with all the astroturf n keeping up with the jones. It was new n fresh after all.

It's all just a lobotomy of the national spirit. Whole generations were taught not to think for themselves, but to follow and obey(mama, tata, Tito/Vučić).When you grow up under such conditioning, fear is natural, just because you we're privileged enough to live a comfy life and be terminally online, hence see why this government is bad, doesn't mean everyone else was in the same position. People are not blind to corruption or suffering, they are scared of what comes after. Rarely they are actually neutral or passive, why? They remember October 5th. They remember what a faggot “revolution” led to. Foreign sponsored chaos, looted industry, more poverty, disappointment. They fear that if they rise up again, it will just open the door to another manipulated “color revolution” where Serbia ends up weaker, poorer, and more divided, and Vučić is playing on that card.Mocking people as servile only shows you're a faggot that don’t understand the trauma and manipulation that shaped them.",

Their goal was to remove a government that acted independently and patriotically, like Milošević’s, and replace it with one more submissive to westoids interests. So even though Slobo's regime had its faults, participating in those protests would have played into a foreign agenda, which is why not taking action then was the right choice.Today’s protests are completely different. They are organic, led by Serbian youth, and have been fiercely independent from any established opposition. From the very start, they’ve actively demonized traditional opposition parties and made it clear they have nothing to do with them, booing them off whenever they appear. These protests are homegrown, authentic, and genuinely focused on Serbian issues, which makes taking action now fundamentally different from what happened in 2000.Also, if CIA jews were actually against Vučić, he would be gone already, but he is giving them everything they want, which is why he has strong support from every globalist faggot, from the east to the west. >>516777701Koja alternative retarde maloumni, ona koja je pokrala 700 miliona evra ali još nije u zatvoru?

Socialism was literally invented as a weapon to distract attention from Hamilton, Henry Clay and Henry C Carey's ideas, based on the French model of dirigisme, where the state can regulate the economy for the public good and direct investment into specific areas. Its the core of the modern nation state, as China is currently proving. In terms of what he did - he pretty much committed to more infrastructure than every other President combined, through the likes of the Public Works Administration and Tennessee Valley Authority, 2 of many, and videos exist of these and all of that infrastructure still exists. Every Dollar that was spent on these projects was returning 2-3x more back from economic activity. Prior to FDR was the Progressive era, the peak of American culture, maybe even the peak of European civilisaton. Yet before that was the Guilded age of robber barons fucking everyone over, rich people 'getting rich' as you call it.",

Basically the ISPs that are members of CUII (which are sadly most German ISPs) volunteer to restrict access to websites that some copyright holders do not like - there are no courts involved. I would say this is anti-consumer, so maybe it should! In fact, some websites blocked by CUII have been found not to host any copyrighted material at all! Anyways, you can find a curated list of websites currently \"blocked\" by CUII here: https://cuiiliste.de/ (They are very mad and powerless about this list, since they effectively applied the Streisand effect to some of these websites, which are in fact pirate sites). Configure your system to resolve DNS queries using an independent service provider, and you can access these websites freely. You should probably do that even if you don't want to visit any of these websites - if your ISP volunteers to refuse your DNS queries, they probably volunteer to snoop on you too! By the way, this praxis is also common with some ISPs in other countries such as the USA. I think we should all adopt Dutch laws around digital privacy and net neutrality.",

        "content": "The relationship Jesus had with the \"Beloved Disciple\" in the Gospel of John is unlike any other. This wasn't just a friendship. It was a bond of breathtaking intimacy.• At the Last Supper, this disciple wasn’t just sitting near Jesus; he was “reclining in the bosom of Jesus” (John 13:23). In that culture, this was a posture of unparalleled intimacy, physical closeness, and affection, usually reserved for a spouse or a beloved child. It signifies a deep, trusting, and physical love.• At the most agonizing moment of his life, hanging on the cross, Jesus looks down and creates a new family. He entrusts the two people he loves most in the world to each other: his mother, Mary, and his Beloved Disciple. He tells her, “Woman, behold your son!” and tells him, “Behold your mother!” (John 19:26-27). He places the person he loves most in the care of the other person he loves most. This is a profound testament to the primacy and sacredness of that bond.To deny the queer love present in these passages is to sanitize the scripture and diminish the radical nature of Jesus's love. He found his most intimate human connection with another man, and the Bible preserves that truth for us.",

          "content": ">>516775663Imagine being so profoundly ignorant of the scripture you claim to defend that you fumble the absolute basics. It's pathetic. Let's break this down so maybe you can learn something.First, the Beloved Disciple was a man. The text is not ambiguous unless you're illiterate.• On the cross, Jesus gives his mother to the disciple's care, literally saying to Mary, \"Woman, behold your son!\" (John 19:26).• After the resurrection, Mary Magdalene runs to Peter and the Beloved Disciple, and he physically outruns Peter to the empty tomb (John 20:4).The Bible is crystal clear on that. Cope.But since you brought up the great Mary Magdalene, let's get to the more interesting point you stumbled into with your hateful little slur. You're right to be threatened by her, but you don't even know why.The early church fathers, terrified of her power, tried to reduce her to a prostitute, but they couldn't erase the fact that she was the Apostle to the Apostles—the one chosen over all the men to be the first witness to the resurrection and to announce the good news. Why her?Because Jesus's entire ministry was about seeing people for who they truly are and liberating them into that truth. The Bible says she was tormented by \"seven demons\" (Luke 8:2). For a woman who had to fight to be seen as her true self in a hostile world, \"seven demons\" is a perfect description of the crushing agony of gender dysphoria and the trauma of social rejection. Jesus didn't just \"cure\" her; he saw her, affirmed her, and cast out the demons of a world that denied her identity.His affirmation of her identity is what reveals his divinity.So, yes. She was a trans woman. A tower of strength (Magdalene = tower) whose transition was blessed and sanctified by Christ himself. He loved her, saw her, and gave her the most important job in Christianity. Thanks for proving you stand with the demons he cast out.",

It is just ONE aspect of who this man is, not his entire being. Just because a man gets a black belt in judo doesn't mean he can't take a day off to go mushroom hunting for example, or parachuting, or go scuba diving or whatever fancy takes him up in the moment, people just aren't that simple. Take homosexuals for example, sure they all do gross anus shit but still, that is just ONE aspect of who they are, they still put their pants on 1 leg at a time, they still go out and eat, the still probably go visit their folks just to say hi.

Its kind of jarring to see how blatant it is, really make it obvious the mods and admins are allowing the shills to run rampant across the whole site. And they're fucking everywhere, even videogames boards are rife with them.But its kind of hilarious how posting truth make these rats jump boat and abandon thread, wouldnt be surprised there are anons who are flagged as hazards that they dont even attempt to argue or strike back, probably because they cause the shills to have mental breakdowns.

I have consciously made note of this myself. But the strangest thing to me is the engagement in the comments under these nonsensical threads. They get constantly updated with new comments just casually going along as if it's totally normal. Seems heavily botted/astroturfed to me. Like, I rarely see any comments calling out the blatant sliding. Weird.Do you also get that vibe?",

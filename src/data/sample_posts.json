It&#039;s these freaks and fluid-types who are rubbing bits together like crazy. <br><br>My little cousin started dressing up in drag during the pandemic lockdowns. His gf was cheering him on, telling him how sexy he looked in her makeup and dresses. Eventually he started leaving the house like that. Then the gf got the ick, left him, and got pregnant immediately by some normie guy. But the thing is, lil&#039; cuz isn&#039;t on any hormones or anything, and can actually kind of &quot;pass&quot; somehow. Now he has a new gf that has a fetish for the trans stuff, and he just fucks tons of guys and girls all the time. <br><br>Like, don&#039;t get me wrong - I hate all of it. But I&#039;m here cranking my own hog, and he&#039;s out having sex.",

The result 10 years later is I am still alive. <br>Sure there are still struggles but there was nothing that was going to ever fix what was wrong but this is far better than it could have been. <br><br>Its to the point literally everyone around me has affirmed and encouraged it. To stop being trans would esentially giving up my entire life entirely and uprooting everything. <br>Saying goodbye to all of my friends amd entire community I had built around be because if I stayed it would just keep being encouraged. <br><br>So what would I do anyway? Sometimes I consider that the one option would be to find a man who is willing to esentially ab use me into detransitioning or maybe just get me pregnant even though its the last thing I think I want but if I am forced ig would set me straight. <br>But of course that isnt realistic either. <br><br>So here we are. 10 years later.",
